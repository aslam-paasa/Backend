/**
 * Unveiling the MERN stack dynamic:
 * => Various components of a MERN stack work together to create a
 *    seamless web application experience:
 * 
 * Understanding:
 * 1. Express as the Backend: 
 * => Express serves as the backend component of the MERN stack. 
 * => It handles data-related tasks, communicates with the database 
 *    (MongoDB), and responds to API requests.
 * 
 * 2. MongoDB for Data Storage: 
 * => MongoDB is the database of choice for storing application data. 
 * => It's where data is persisted and retrieved by the Express server.
 * 
 * 3. React on the Frontend: 
 * => React is a powerful frontend library that manages the user interface
 *    and renders components dynamically. 
 * => It handles the client-side rendering of views and allows for 
 *    responsive and interactive user experiences.
 * 
 * 4. CDN Hosting for React: 
 * => React-based applications are hosted on Content Delivery Networks(CDNs).
 * => This means that the static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) of the 
 *    React application are distributed globally for fast and efficient 
 *    delivery to users.
 * 
 * 5. Separation of Concerns: 
 * => MERN stack follows the principle of separation of concerns. 
 * => Express handles data and API requests, while React focuses on the 
 *    user interface. 
 * => This separation allows for better code organization and maintenance.
 * 
 * 6. Communication Between Express and React: 
 * => While React handles the frontend views, it doesn't directly 
 *    communicate with Express for static assets. 
 * => However, React does make API requests to the Express backend to 
 *    fetch or send data. 
 * => Express responds to these requests with JSON data.
