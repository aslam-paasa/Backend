/**
 * Q. Verify a token with error handling, specifically handling the
 *    case where the token is incorrect or has expired.

/**
 * Explanation:
 * 1. If the token is valid, the try block's code is executed, and the
 *    decoded payload is printed to the console.
 * 2. If the token is invalid(e.g., incorrect or expired), an error is
 *    thrown, and it's caught by the catch block, which prints an error
 *    message.
