/**
 * Learn how to fetch data by sorting:
 * Q. Read all movies sorted by release year:
 * => Create a function readMoviesByReleaseYear that retrieves all movies
 *    from the database and sorts them in ascending order based on their
 *    release years.    
 *
 * Note: If we have less data like 100 to 500 array of objects, we can
 *       do the filter, sort etc in the frontend. But if the array of
 *       objects are bigger then do the sorting, filtering etc in the
 *       backend.
 *    => Frontend calls are faster than backend but if the data is big
 *       and we put a sort of filter on it like pagination, it can
 *       also make our UI unresponsive. So, do deligate balance between
 *       frontend and backend.
