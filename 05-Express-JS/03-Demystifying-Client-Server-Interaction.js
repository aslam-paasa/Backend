/**
 * Q. Demystifying Client-Server Interaction:
 * => Understanding how a client's request is processed by a server is 
 *    essential in web development.
 * => Let's break down the process step by step:
 * 
 * 1. Client Sends a Request:
 * => A client(usually a browser) sends a request to a server by specifying
 *    a URL in the browser's address bar.
 * 
 * 2. Server Decodes the Request:
 * => Server receives the request, decodes the URL to identify the desired
 *    resource(route), and determines the HTTP verb used.
 * 
 * 3. HTTP Verbs:
 * => The HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) indicate the type of 
 *    action the client wants to perform on the resource.
 * 
 * 4. GET Requests:
 * => A GET request is used to retrieve data from the server. When a client
 *    makes a GET request, it's asking the server to provide information.
